I chose a cursus in Marine Biology thanks to a course I took at Napier University (Edinburgh), where we learned about deep seas organisms. I found them fascinating (who wouldn't...). This is partly what made me choose my Master in Aquatic Ecology. During my first internship, I ended up working relatively far from deap seas organisms, as I worked on clams in a bay (Arcachon Bay, 10 m bsl). But things got out of control when I worked on a high-altitude lake (Lake Anterne, 2,063 m asl) during my 2nd year. Of course, these internships were fascinating. While I will forever struggle with the gulf between what I want to study and the average human life expectancy, my research interests revolve around how systems are responding to local and global perturbations. 

I could list my publications, but I might as well link my <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8351-7539" target="_blank">ORCID profile</a>, that is guaranteed to be up to date.
